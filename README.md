# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A **Machine Learning-based application** that recommends movies to users based on their preferences and similarity scores.  
This project demonstrates how **content-based filtering** can be applied using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to build a scalable movie recommendation pipeline.
